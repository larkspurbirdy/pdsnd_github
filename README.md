### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Explorer

### Description
The bikeshare.py program provides a user-friendly interface to access and interpret bikeshare data from three cities: Chicago, New York, and Washington DC.

### Files used
Three CSV files contain the bikeshare data accessed by the program:
  * chicago.csv
  * new_york_city.csv
  * washington.csv

The data include start and end time of bike checkouts, duration of trips, start and end stations, and information about the users including gender and birth year.

### Credits
The structure of the bikeshare.py program was built by **Udacity**.
The ASCII bike art in the program was found at [Christopher Johnson's ASCII Art Collection](https://asciiart.website/index.php?art=transportation/bicycles "Title").
